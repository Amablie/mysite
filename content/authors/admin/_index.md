I am a Statistician student at the Federal University of Paraná, actively participating as a scholarship holder,in a nacional program developing teaching, research, and extension activities since the second year of graduation. In my free time I'm looking to get to know the day-to-day of a data professional in the job market.
Currently I'm working as a data intern in the credit area of one of the largest chemical companies in Belgium, helping a global team with process automation, analysis, and collecting information for business decisions.
